  What is it?
  -----------

  The QuestBoard Mobile Application is a user-friendly resource 
  for medieval knights and heroes.  QuestBoard allows kings, townsfolks, 
  and damsels in distress to connect with a hero by posting their 
  available quests.  Heroes and knights may then view quests within 
  nearby kingdoms in order to decide which heroic challenges they would 
  like to pursue.
